# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `app/`: Next.js App Router pages; global styles live in `globals.css`.
- `components/`: shared UI primitives; `components/ui/` mirrors shadcn PascalCase exports.
- `lib/`: API clients (`lib/api`), enums, and helpers; keep shared network logic here.
- `hooks/`: framework-agnostic reusable hooks such as `use-mobile`.
- `backend/`: FastAPI service with routers in `backend/routers/` and constants in `backend/constants/`.
- `public/`: static assets served by Next.js; exclude generated bundles.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `pnpm install`: sync web dependencies (use pnpm to respect the lockfile).
- `pnpm dev`: start Next.js with Turbopack on `http://localhost:3000`.
- `pnpm build` then `pnpm start`: build and serve the production bundle before release.
- `pnpm lint`: run ESLint across app, components, hooks, and lib.
- `python -m venv .venv && pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`: install backend dependencies inside a virtualenv.
- `uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000`: run FastAPI locally; adjust `NBA_API_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` as needed.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript uses 2-space indentation, PascalCase component files, and camelCase functions or hooks (`useExample`).
- Keep Tailwind classes beside the JSX they style; avoid inline style objects.
- Prefer named exports and absolute imports via the `@/` alias.
- Backend modules follow PEP 8 with 4-space indentation, snake_case functions, and PascalCase Pydantic models.
- Run `pnpm lint` before commits and accept ESLint autofix output instead of manual overrides.

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated suite is committed yet; linting and manual review are the current checks.
- Add frontend specs with Vitest + React Testing Library under `__tests__/` beside the component.
- Add backend Pytest cases under `backend/tests/` using `TestClient`; aim for â‰¥80% coverage on new modules and document fixtures briefly in the PR.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Use imperative, present-tense commit subjects (`Add players table`) with optional scopes (`feat:`).
- Reference related issues (`#42`) in commits or PR descriptions when relevant.
- PRs must summarize changes, call out schema or API updates, and attach screenshots or curl snippets for UI or API work.
- Verify `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`, and backend startup locally before review; note any skipped steps.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Keep secrets in an untracked `.env`; never check in credentials or long-lived tokens.
- Align `NBA_API_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` across frontend and backend deployments and redact env values when sharing logs.
